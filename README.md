A 3D Game Engine using DirectX 11.
This is a personal project to learn the basics behind 3D game engines.
My goal is to allow manual live switching of interfaces, various shaders and other fun stuff mostly for learning purposes, but also to see what whacky things can be done.
This engine was helped in large part from tutorials at http://www.braynzarsoft.net/ and http://www.rastertek.com/ .
I used FW1FontWrapper (https://fw1.codeplex.com/) to greatly simplify writing text to the screen. 
Created in Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 10.



Note: Backwards compatibility was not taken into consideration when creating this!
I seriously doubt this will work if you are not running DirectX 11 with a compatible gfx card.
Also, Windows 10 is recommended (Windows 8.1 should be ok??)
