A 3D Game Engine using DirectX 11.
This is a personal project to learn the basics behind 3D game engines.
Created in Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 10.

Note: Backwards compatibility was not taken into consideration when creating this!
I seriously doubt this will work if you are not running DirectX 11 with a compatible gfx card.
Also, Windows 10 is recommended (Windows 8.1 should be ok??)
